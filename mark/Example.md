> the following characters:

> ` backtick  
> \* asterisk  
> _ underscore  
> {} curly braces

## 8. Username @Mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment.
This is called an "@mention", because you're mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams
within an organization.

## 9. Issue References
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.
> \#1  
> github-flavored-markdown#1  
> de-funk/github-flavored-markdown#1

## 11. Fenced Code Blocks
Markdown converts text with four leading spaces into a code block; with GFM you can wrap your code with ``` to create a 
code block without the leading spaces. Add an optional language identifier and your code will get syntax highlighting.

```javascript
function test(){
    console.log("look ma', no spaces");
}
```

## 12. Task Lists
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)

## 13. Tables
you can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then 
separating each column with a pipe |:

> First Header | Second Header
> ------------ | -------------
> Content cell 1 | Content cell 2
> Content column 1 | content column 2
